## Business Logic

### Interest Calculation
- Monthly interest rate = Annual rate / 12
- Monthly interest charge = Current balance Ã— Monthly rate
- Principal payment = Total payment - Interest charge

### Payoff Strategies

#### Snowball Method
1. Make minimum payments on all debts
2. Apply extra payment to debt with smallest balance
3. When a debt is paid off, add its payment to the next smallest
4. Provides psychological wins and momentum

#### Avalanche Method
1. Make minimum payments on all debts
2. Apply extra payment to debt with highest interest rate
3. When a debt is paid off, add its payment to the next highest rate
4. Mathematically optimal - saves the most money

### Payment Processing
1. Calculate interest portion based on current balance
2. Apply remaining payment to principal
3. Update debt balance
4. Mark as paid off if balance reaches zero
5. Track payment history for reporting

## Testing

The feature includes comprehensive tests:
- Unit tests for debt service methods

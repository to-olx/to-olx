# Budget Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview

I have successfully implemented a comprehensive budgeting feature for DebtWise that includes budgets, rollovers, and summaries as requested in Linear issue TOO-8.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Models (`app/models/budget.py`)
- **Budget Model**: Core budget configuration with support for different period types (weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly)
- **BudgetPeriod Model**: Tracks spending within specific time periods with rollover support
- **BudgetAlert Model**: Configurable threshold-based alerts for budget monitoring

### 2. API Schemas (`app/schemas/budget.py`)
- Request/response schemas for all budget operations
- Support for creating budgets with alerts
- Comprehensive summary and overview responses
- Rollover request/response handling

### 3. Business Logic (`app/services/budget.py`)
- Complete CRUD operations for budgets
- Automatic period creation and management
- Rollover calculations with configurable limits
- Real-time spending tracking against budgets
- Budget summary generation with analytics
- Alert management

### 4. API Endpoints (`app/api/v1/endpoints/budgets.py`)
- `POST /api/v1/budgets/budgets` - Create budget
- `GET /api/v1/budgets/budgets` - List budgets
- `GET /api/v1/budgets/budgets/{id}` - Get budget
- `PUT /api/v1/budgets/budgets/{id}` - Update budget
- `DELETE /api/v1/budgets/budgets/{id}` - Delete budget
- `GET /api/v1/budgets/budgets/summary/overview` - Overall budget overview
- `GET /api/v1/budgets/budgets/{id}/summary` - Budget summary
- `POST /api/v1/budgets/budgets/rollover` - Process rollovers
- Alert management endpoints

### 5. Key Features Implemented

#### Budget Creation
- Support for category-specific or total budgets
- Configurable period types (weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly)
- Optional rollover settings with limits

#### Rollover Functionality
- Automatic rollover of unused budget amounts
- Configurable maximum rollover periods
- Configurable maximum rollover amount
- Period closing when processing rollovers

#### Budget Summaries
- Real-time spending tracking
- Percentage used calculations
- Projected end-of-period spending
- Days remaining in period
- Average monthly spending trends
- Active alert notifications
- Unbudgeted spending tracking

### 6. Testing & Documentation
- Comprehensive test suite (`tests/api/v1/test_budgets.py`)
- Example usage script (`examples/budget_example.py`)
- Detailed feature documentation (`docs/BUDGETING_FEATURE.md`)

## How to Use

### 1. Create a Budget
```python
POST /api/v1/budgets/budgets
{
    "name": "Monthly Groceries",
    "category_id": 1,
    "period_type": "monthly",
    "start_date": "2024-01-01",
    "amount": "500.00",
    "allow_rollover": true,
    "max_rollover_periods": 3
}
```

### 2. Get Budget Summary
```python
GET /api/v1/budgets/budgets/1/summary

# Returns spending analysis, percentage used, projections, etc.
```

### 3. Process Rollover
```python
POST /api/v1/budgets/budgets/rollover
{
    "budget_id": 1
}
```

## Database Setup

To create the new budget tables, run:

```bash
cd /workspace/debtwise-api
python -m app.core.db_init
```

Or use Docker:
```bash
docker-compose up -d db
docker-compose run api python -m app.core.db_init
```

## Dependencies Added

- `python-dateutil>=2.8.0` - For date calculations in budget periods

## Next Steps

The budgeting feature is fully implemented and ready for use. Consider these potential enhancements:

1. **Email/Push Notifications**: Implement actual alert delivery
2. **Budget Templates**: Pre-configured budget setups
3. **Budget Goals**: Savings targets
4. **Advanced Analytics**: More detailed insights and predictions
5. **Budget Sharing**: Family/group budgets
6. **Mobile API Optimizations**: Efficient endpoints for mobile apps

## Testing

Run the example script to see the feature in action:
```bash
cd /workspace/debtwise-api
python examples/budget_example.py
```

Run tests:
```bash
pytest tests/api/v1/test_budgets.py -v
```
